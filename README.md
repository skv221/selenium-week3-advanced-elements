# selenium-week3-advanced-elements

### **Overview**
This repository contains the work and scripts developed for Week 3 of my Python Selenium Learning Journey. The focus of this week was mastering advanced web elements and interactions, including dropdowns, alerts, iframes, window/tab switching, and keyboard/mouse actions.

### **Key Tasks and Highlights**

1. **Handling Dropdowns with Click and Hover Actions**  
   - Automated interaction with dropdown menus requiring clicks or hover actions.  
   - Practiced selecting options from dynamic dropdowns.  

2. **Handling Alerts**  
   - Automated handling of simple, confirmation, and prompt alerts.  
   - Captured alert messages and implemented dismissal workflows.

3. **Working with Iframes**  
   - Navigated into and out of iframes to interact with elements within them.  
   - Performed actions both inside the iframe and on the main page.

4. **Switching Between Windows and Tabs**  
   - Automated the opening of new browser tabs/windows.  
   - Extracted and printed content from new tabs/windows.  

5. **Keyboard and Mouse Actions with ActionChains**  
   - Simulated advanced keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C).  
   - Performed drag-and-drop operations, right-click actions, and hover interactions.
